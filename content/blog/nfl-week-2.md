I'm going to try to do something for this NFL season.
Before each Sunday, I'm going to guess the spreads of each game.
I'm going to record the games that I was at least two points off.

# More Than 2 Points Off

**Rams (+1)** at Cardinals

# Exactly 2 Points Off

49ers at **Vikings (+5.5)**

**Bucs (+7.5)** at Lions

(Edit, morning of 9/15): I have since realized that I failed to take into account injuries when guessing these spreads. The Rams have a very injured offensive line, and the Bucs have an injured secondary. Oh well.
