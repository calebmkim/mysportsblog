I recently wrote a [blog post][nba-historical-rankings] ranking every NBA champion since 2011.
Since then, I've thought about it some more; I've also read other [blog posts][msn-blog] and listened to [podcasts][td3-pod] on this exact topic.
I'll recap where I've changed my mind (and where I haven't) since my initial blog post.

# Top 5: Still the Same
My top 5 teams were:

1. '16-'17 Warriors
2. '17-'18 Warriors
3. '13-'14 Spurs
4. '12-'13 Heat
5. '15-'16 Cavs

I still feel pretty good about these teams as the top 5 (and in that exact order).

# Rearrange 6-9
My 6-9 teams were:

6. '11-'12 Heat
7. '23-'24 Celtics
8. '22-'23 Nuggets
9. '14-'15 Warriors

Probably the "hottest take" of my original list was having the '22-'23 Nuggets ahead of the '14-'15 Warriors.
After thinking about it, the Nuggets just don't have the stats of an elite team.
I still think the Nuggets were really impressive using my "eye test"â€“ but my "eye test" also thought that the Mavs were more impressive than the Celtics leading up to last year's Finals, and the Celtics easily won the series in 5 games.
So I would re-rank the Nuggets as a pretty clear 9th.

I would still rank the '23-'24 Celtics ahead of the 14-'15 Warriors, who I think are slightly overrated for reasons that I already discussed in the previous blog post.

While the '11-'12 Heat did have Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, in addition to beating a great Thunder team in the Finals that year, their overall stats just weren't that good.
One common theme I'm realizing is that I don't think I put enough emphasis on stats, and I put too much emphasis on eye test (in the case of the Nuggets) and big names (in the case of the Heat).
I would drop them below both the Celtics and the Warriors.

So my updated rankings are:

6. '23-'24 Celtics
7. '14-'15 Warriors
8. '11-'12 Heat
9. '22-'23 Nuggets

# Actually Ranking Teams 10-12 Instead of Picking a Tie

Originally I had the following teams tied for 10th: the '19-'20 Lakers, '18-'19 Raptors, and '10-'11 Mavs.
I still think it's very close between these three teams, but I feel like I kind of took the easy way out by selecting a tie, and I don't want to do that anymore.

Even though the Mavs had an all-time great playoff run, I think I would place them last among these three teams: they didn't have great regular season stats, nor did they have a great roster.
Between the '19-'20 Lakers and the '18-'19 Raptors, I guess I would pick the '19-'20 Lakers: when in doubt, I am going to lean towards the team with the better top-end stars, and the Lakers had Lebron and AD.

So the updated rankings are:

10. '19-'20 Lakers
11. '18-'19 Raptors
12. '10-'11 Mavs

# Ranking the last 2 teams

The final two teams were:

13. '21-'22 Warriors
14. '20-'21 Bucks

I feel pretty good about these rankings.
I think I'm lower on the '20-'21 Bucks than most.
In fact, if I were to change anything, I might have the '21-'22 Warriors ahead of the '10-'11 Mavs.

# Conclusion: My Updated Rankings

1. '16-'17 Warriors
2. '17-'18 Warriors
3. '13-'14 Spurs
4. '12-'13 Heat
5. '15-'16 Cavs
6. '23-'24 Celtics
7. '14-'15 Warriors
8. '11-'12 Heat
9. '22-'23 Nuggets
10. '19-'20 Lakers
11. '18-'19 Raptors
12. '10-'11 Mavs
13. '21-'22 Warriors
14. '20-'21 Bucks
