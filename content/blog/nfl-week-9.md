# My Picks

Rams at **Seahawks (+1.5)**. Bills were 3 point favorites at Seattle last week. Rams are 1.5 ppoint favorites at Seattle this week. I think there is a bit of recency bias here of the Rams just beating the Vikings, and the Seahawks getting blown out. 

**Commanders (-4)** at Giants. I just don't think the Giants are that good. 

**Saints (-7)** at Panthers. I just don't think the Panthers are very good. 

**Patriots (+3)** at Titans. Teams that play the Lions always lose the next week (the theory is that this is because the Lions are such a physical team). I'll go with the Patriots here.
