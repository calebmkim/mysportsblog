Here are the picks this week.

# My Picks

Ravens at **Browns (+8)**. Ravens are favored by too many points in my opinion, since I think Jameis Winston will be significantly better than Deshaun Watson. Ravens are on a short week too.

**Colts (+5)** at Texans. Colts are playing pretty well recently, and Nico Collins not playing for Texans. 

**Bills (-3)** at Seahawks. I listened to a podcast that made the point that the Bills generally blow out average/bad teams; that is what I'm betting on here. 

**Chiefs (-8.5)** at Raiders. Big road favorite, but I am going purely on the psychological aspect here of (1) the Chiefs wanting revenge for losing last Christmas, and (2) the Raiders [mocking](https://x.com/AdamSchefter/status/1850502324088668476?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) Mahomes as Kermit the Frog.

**Cowboys (+5)** at 49ers. I don't want this to happen, but Cowboys are coming off a bye and the 49ers are quite injured. 5 is a lot of points.
