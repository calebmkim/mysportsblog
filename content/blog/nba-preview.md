I'm a bit busy, but I still want to make some NBA predictions. 
I was on a flight today and listened to [The Bill Simmons Podcast](bs-pod) where they did over/unders for each time: it was 4.5 hours total. 
I haven't really done that much research on my own for the NBA this year, so I was heavily influenced by their opinions.

## My Picks (ordered from my most to least favorite bets)

Spurs Under 35.5

Pistons Over 26.5 

Heat Over 43.5 

Rockets Over 42.5 

Bucks Under 49.5 

## Standings Predictions

Some of this is sort of wishful thinking. The Rockets and Kings making the playoffs over the Lakers and Warriors, for instance. 

## East 

1. Celtics 
2. Knicks
3. 76ers 
4. Cavs
5. Bucks
6. Heat

## West

1. Thunder
2. Timberwolves
3. Nuggets
