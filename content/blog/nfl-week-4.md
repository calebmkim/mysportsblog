This week, I didn't find too many games where my guesses for what the spread were differed drastically from the actual spread.
But I found some games to pick anyway.

# My Picks

Vikings at **Packers (-3)**

Steelers at **Colts (+2)**

**Rams (+3)** at Bears

Bills at **Ravens (-2.5)**

Seahawks at **Lions (-3.5)**
