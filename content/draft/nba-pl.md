Radio host Colin Cowherd is known for making some pretty weird sports analogies.
For example, he did one segment where he compared NFL quarterbacks to [thanksgiving foods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4UWDXjnoDM).
He did another segment where he compared NFL quarterbacks to [Hollywood actors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLvBnxTwOE4).
I love these videos.[^1]
They're really fun, and for some reason most of his comparisons seem pretty spot-on.
In this blog post, I'll take my shot at comparing NBA players to programming languages.

Please don't take this too seriously. I'm just having fun.

#### Kevin Durant: Python

Kevin Durant is considered the most "malleable" superstar in the NBA by both [fans](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/11ynutt/kd_is_definitely_the_most_plug_and_play_superstar/) and [media](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2023/4/25/23696667/kevin-durant-phoenix-suns-basketball-nomad).
In other words, you can instantly plug him in to any team, and he will mesh well with that team.

The main reason people say this is that he doesn't dominate the ball compared to similar superstars.
Let's compare him with arguably the two most similar superstars in the NBA (at least height and position-wise): Luka Dončić and Lebron James.
I [calculated](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/touches?PerMode=PerGame&Season=2020-21&dir=D&sort=TOUCHES) each player's "Touch %": the percentage of game time that player spends touching the ball while they are on court
(There are 10 players on the court at a time, so the "average" NBA player would be about 10%).
I also compared their points per 48 minutes (if we estimate the average NBA team scores about 110 points per game, then you would expect the "average" player to score about 22 points per 48 minutes).

| Player       | Touch%           | Points Per 48 Minutes             |
|--------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Kevin Durant | **10.8%**        | **39**                         |
| Luka Doncic  | 26.1%            | 38.8                       |
| Lebron James | 19.1%            | 35.9                       |

KD was able to score more points than Lebron or Luka while touching the ball for significantly less time.
Obviously some of this can be explained by the fact that Lebron and Luka bring the ball up the court more often than KD: but I still don't think it explains the full discrepency.
There's something about KD's game that doesn't require him to have the ball as much as other superstars, yet he still is able to score at a similar volume.

There are other reasons why teams don't have to change the way they play if KD were to join their team.
He's also a really good shooter so he doesn't mess with your spacing (he is not like Giannis Antetekounpo, where his 7'1'' teammate Brook Lopez has to stand on the perimeter and shoot 3's).
And he's also good enough defender so his teams don't have to shift defensive assignments to cover for his deficiencies (which the Warriors arguably have to do with Steph Curry), and he's tall and athletic enough to guard multiple positions.

So when KD is on your team, you don't have to give him the ball all the time, he doesn't mess up your spacing, and you don't have to shift around your defensive assignments: in short, he is very *malleable*.

So why is he similar to Python?

Because Python seems like one of the most malleable programming languages.
From my experience, you can quickly learn and pick up Python compared to other language.
It has intuitive syntax and semantics, and it has things
For example, it is the language that my college uses for its "Programming 101" course.

And once you know Python, I have found it very easy to quickly hack up a small script to do a specific task.
It also has a lot of libraries for a variety of your needs.

However, there are some downsides to Python: while it is great for a script you need to cobble together quickly, it's generally not seen as good of a choice for large-scale projects. In particular, its dynamically typing and slow performance make it less than ideal.

Plus, there's a meme about Durant being a [snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfgHeIpMfMc) when he left the Thunder to join the Warriors in 2016.
#### Kobe Bryant: C++ and Lebron James: Java

#### Steph Curry: Rust
