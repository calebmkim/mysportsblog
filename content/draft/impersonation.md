I consider myself somewhat decent (but not great) at doing accents and impersonations.
In other words, I would like to think I'm better at doing impersonations than the median person on the street, but not anywhere near some of the professionals on TV.
I used to love watching really good impersonators, both for entertainment value and to improve my own impersonations.
In particular, I remember there were a surprising number of good Obama impersonators: _, _, _,?

So what makes a good impersonator?
On the surface the answer is obvious: a good impersonator sounds similar to the person they are trying to impersonate.
But I'm not sure if this is quite right: if you listen back to many of the really good Obama impersonator, and then listen to Obama himself speaking, they don't *really* sound all that similar.
You can definitely tell which is the impersonator and which is Obama himself.
Moreover, from my personal experience, if I attempt to learn an impersonation by trying to simply mimic exactly how that person sounds, it usually ends up as a failure.

You might say: "Of course impersonators don't sound *exactly* like the person they're trying to impersonate, but they get pretty close. So while nobody exactly hits the mark, we still judge how good (or bad) impersonators by how closely (or far away) they sound to their subjects".
This may be correct, but I'm going to propose something different, that lines up more with my personal experience and how I believe humans view similarity.

When a person speaks, many aspects of their voice sound very similar to many others.
But they also have a few distinctive features when they talk that are unique to them.
Obama has a few:
- Sometimes he kind of starts sentences a slowly and with a low voice, and then kind of speeds up and raises his pitch towards the end of the sentence or phrase.
- Sometimes he has this low, scratchy "ehhhhh" when he's searching for what word to use next.
- And his most distinctive but hardest to describe characteristic: it's almost like he has a big round bubble in his mouth or something that he's trying to throw up. I have no idea if this description makes any sense, but it's always the sense I got.

I would argue that the "good" Obama impersonators do not necessarily *mimic* these characteristics exactly as Obama does them: rather, they *exaggerate* these characteristics.
Not only do they exaggerate their severity (e.g., how much Obama speeds up at the end of his sentences), but they also exaggerate how often he does these things (e.g., how much Obama uses the low scratchy "ehhhh").
So a good impersonator doesn't necessarily mimic/sound similar to their subject: rather, they (sometimes comically) *exaggerate the distinctive characteristics of their subject*.
This has definitely been true for me when I attempt an impersonation.
In general, I'm much more successful when I try to exaggerate the distinctive characteristics of the subject rather than try to mimic all the different characteristics of the subject.

I recently read *The Undoing Project* by Michael Lewis, which summarizes the life and research of two Israeli psychologists, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.
The most succinct way to describe their work is identifying and understanding optical illusions, but for the brain (Lewis uses this analogy several times throughout the book).
For example, if you give people a passage to read, and then ask them:

Were there more words in the passage whose first letter was _, or whose third letter was _?

Most people will say the first letter, even if the answer is the third letter.
There is a fairly obvious reason for this: it is simply easier for us to recall words whose first letter is _, compared to the third letter.
In general, we tend to remember the first letter of _ but not the third letter.

(Insert explanation of how people view similarity).

A lot of the book generalized some observations I had already made in specific.
This includes my view of impersonations.
