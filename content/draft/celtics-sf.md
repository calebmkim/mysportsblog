In art and entertainment, there are some interesting differences between the tastes of critics and the public.
For instance, the public loved the movie *Where the Crawdads Sing*, giving it a [96/100](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/where_the_crawdads_sing) on Rotten Tomatoes.
But critics hated it, giving the movie a 35/100.
There are plenty of movies in which the [reverse](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_witch_2016) is true as well.
The consensus seems to be that the public prefers dramatic, faster-paced movies with more plot and less dialogue, while
critics enjoy subtle, slower-paced, movies with more dialogue and less plot.

In this blog, I will introduces a similar idea in the realm of sports.
However, instead of a gulf in taste between the public and critics, the difference is between the public and the oddsmakers (a bit similar to "sharps vs squares").
Just like certain characteristics (dialogue > plot, slower-paced, subtle) are valued more by critics than the public, I think there are also certain characteristics in sports teams that are more valued by oddsmakers versus the general public.

## Vegas vs. The Public

Imagine it's February 11, 2024: the Chiefs have just won Super Bowl 58, despite having what was probably their worst regular season since Mahomes began playing for them.
They're now back-to-back Super Bowl champions, they have the best player and probably the best coach in the NFL, and they're bringing most of their key players back.
They seem inevitable.

Can you guess who the favorites were for the next Super Bowl?

Surprisingly, Vegas [pegged](https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nfl-main/?y=2024&sa=nfl&a=sb&p=pre&o=r) the 49ers-- the team they just *beat* in the Super Bowl-- as next year's favorites.[^1]
And it wasn't even particularly close: the 49ers were +500 (i.e., 5 to 1), while the Chiefs were at +750.
Most sports fans, myself included, couldn't figure this out: how could the 2-time defending champions with (probably) the best coach and quarterback, not be favored?
They had just won a Super Bowl during a *down* year.

This wasn't the first time Vegas has disagreed with the public.

I remember hearing about this before Super Bowl 48: Seahawks vs. Broncos.
This was back in Russell Wilson's 2nd year, when the Seahawks' strength was their ["Legion of Boom"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Boom_(Seattle_Seahawks)) defense.
Peyton Manning had just finished his best year for the Broncos-- and arguably the best season for a quarterback in NFL history.
He had just [broken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning) the NFL record for passing touchdowns and yards in a season, and the Broncos were the highest scoring team in NFL history.

Vegas (and "sharp" bettors) [liked](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1946624-super-bowl-xlviii-betting-recap-sportsbooks-win-big-on-seahawks) the Seahawks, while the public liked the Broncos.
The spread opened at Seattle -1, but the public money on the Broncos [shifted](https://www.sbnation.com/odds/2014/1/21/5330372/super-bowl-2014-betting-odds-denver-broncos-favored-vs-seattle-seahawks) to the spread to Denver -2.5 by kickoff. [^2]

## In Basketball Too

This also happens in other sports.
I'm thinking in particular of Vegas' love of the Celtics the past couple years.
Prior to the start of the conference semifinals in the 2022-2023 playoffs, the Celtics [were](https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nba-main/?y=2022-2023&sa=nba&a=finals&o=r) +180 to win the title.
The eventual champion Nuggets were at +700.
The Celtics ended up losing in the conference finals to the Heat: it's difficult to describe how bad they looked in that series.
In addition to needing a game winning put back buzzer beater in game 6 just to force a game 7 (which they ended up losing by 20 at home),
it just looked like the Celtics were basically just giving the ball to one of their guys and waiting around for him to shoot a 3.
The Nuggets played the Heat in the finals that year and easily beat them in 5 games.
Watching the Nuggets, they just seemed to play as a *team* so much better than Boston: they're a lot less dependent on shooting 3's, there's a lot more movement and cutting, etc.
I don't have any sources for this, but just listening to fans and media, I think this is how most fans feel.

After all this, can you guess what the title odds were going into the next season?
They had basically [identical](https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nba-main/?y=2023-2024&sa=nba&a=finals&o=r) title odds.
The Nuggets were actually slight favorites, at +500, compared to the Celtics at +550.
But the fact that the Celtics were *still* getting basically the same odds as Denver, despite looking so much worse in the playoffs, was surprising.
Also, once the Celtics traded for Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis in the offseason, the odds shifted back in their favor: +400 for them, +550 for the Nuggets.

The Celtics went on to have a [historically](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1c4a82w/the_bostons_celtics_end_the_2324_season_with_the/) great regular season, so it's understandable that they were title favorites heading into the playoffs.
Yet fans are still skeptical of the Celtics:
I remember listening to Celtics fan Bill Simmons saying he doesn't think they can beat the Nuggets in a 7-game series [^3].
Kevin O'Connor [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/billsimmons/comments/1ccgyzw/kevin_ocopium_the_celtics_would_get_swept_by/) that the Celtics would get *swept* by the Nuggets.

## So, Why?

In summary: Vegas likes Kyle Shanahan's 49ers, the Legion of Boom Seahawks, and Mazulla's Celtics, while the public likes Mahomes' Chiefs, Peyton Manning's Broncos, and Jokic's Nuggets.

This isn't a huge sample size, but there is a bit of a pattern here.
The public cares more about star power, while Vegas cares more about overall roster construction.
For football--they particularly care about star power at quarterback, e.g., Mahomes and Peyton Manning.
Vegas cares more about well-rounded rosters: Purdy and Russell Wilson were both good, but the key was that they were late-ish picks on their (cheap) rookie deals, which allowed their teams to stack the rest of their roster. [^4]
In basketball, Jokic is considered the best player in the world, while Tatum is considered good but not close to Jokic.
This seems to have a greater pull amongst the fans, while Vegas cares more about the Celtics' stacked supporting cast: Jrue Holiday was arguably their worst starter (and he was the 2nd best player on the number 1 seed Bucks the year before).

While Vegas *really* cares about roster construction, it has no problem dismissing team record, i.e., it easily dismisses teams with good records if it thinks they're getting lucky while they will sometimes continue to respect teams with bad records.
(Obviously this can't apply to any of the examples I've shown thus far, since all of them were championship contenders with good records.)
The best example of this is when unranked, 3-3 USC was [favored](https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2015/10/24/9609422/usc-utah-final-score-advanced-stats-rankings) over 6-0 and #3 ranked Utah (they opened as 3 point favorites, closed as 6.5 point favorites, and ended up winning the game by 18).
USC had so many more 4 and 5 star recruits on their roster compared to Utah, so Vegas has no problem dismissing each teams' respective record.
Another example is when the 10-2 Vikings were 1.5 point [underdogs](https://www.espn.com/nfl/game/_/gameId/401437892/vikings-lions) against the 6-6 Lions in the 2022 season (the Lions ended up winning 34-23).
The 2022 Vikings were an example of a team with a good record that kept on finding ways to win, but every week was dismissed by the bookmakers.

In basketball, I also get the sense that fans care more about "vibes" and "eye test", while it seems that Vegas cares more about stats.
There's something about Denver that you just trust (especially in the clutch); they just look like a well-oiled machine when they play.
And there just seems to be something off vibes-wise with the Celtics; but it seems like Vegas doesn't care about that as much as the Celtics' record-breaking point differential.

So: Vegas cares about overall roster construction and less about overall team record, while the public cares more about star power, "eye test", and team record.

If it does (or doesn't), send me an email with your thoughts.

[^1] It's true that the odds have shifted since then. I'm guessing that part of that is due to the [uncertainty](https://www.si.com/nfl/john-lynch-says-the-49ers-wont-trade-brandon-aiyuk-or-deebo-samuel#:~:text=The%2049ers%20seriously%20considered%20trading,on%20The%20Pat%20McAfee%20Show.) about Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel. Also, maybe there was some public money coming in on the Chiefs.

[^2] In case you were curious about the result, the Seahawks won in a blowout, 43-8. But that doesn't mean sharp bettors are always right-- a single game is an almost meaninglessly small sample size, in my opinion.

[^3] This was before the Nuggets vs. T-Wolves series started.

[^4] To just name a few: 49ers had: McCaffrey, Kittle, Aiyuk, Deebo Samuel, etc. On defense, they had Nick Bosa, Fred Warner, etc. Seahawks had Marshawn Lynch, Percy Harvin, Doug Baldwin, on offense. On defense they had the Legion of Boom: Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas, etc.
