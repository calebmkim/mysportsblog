## Vegas vs. The Public

Imagine its February 11: the Chiefs have just won Super Bowl 58, despite having what was probably their worst regular season since Mahomes began playing for them.
They're now back-to-back Super Bowl champions, they have the best player and probably the best coach in the NFL, and they're bringing most of their key players back.
They just seem inevitable.

Can you guess who the favorites were for the next Super Bowl?

Surprisingly, Vegas [pegged](https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nfl-main/?y=2024&sa=nfl&a=sb&p=pre&o=r) the 49ers-- the team they just *beat* in the Super Bowl-- as next year's favorites.[^1]
And it wasn't even particularly close: the 49ers were +500, while the Chiefs were at +750.
Most sports fans, myself included, couldn't figure this out: how could the 2-time defending champions with (probably) the best coach and quarterback, not be favored?
They had just won a Super Bowl during a *down* year.

This wasn't the first time Vegas has disagreed with the public.

I remember hearing about this before Super Bowl 48: Seahawks vs. Broncos.
Russell Wilson had just finished his 2nd year starting for the Seahawks.
Back then, the Seahawks' strength was their ["Legion of Boom"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Boom_(Seattle_Seahawks)) defense.
Peyton Manning had just finished his best year for the Broncos-- and arguably the best season for a quarterback in NFL history.
He had just [broken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning) the NFL record for passing touchdowns and yards in a season, and the Broncos were the highest scoring team in NFL history.

Vegas (and "sharp" bettors) [liked](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1946624-super-bowl-xlviii-betting-recap-sportsbooks-win-big-on-seahawks) the Seahawks, while the public liked the Broncos.
The spread opened at Seahawks -1, but the public started putting money on the Broncos, so the spread had [shifted](https://www.sbnation.com/odds/2014/1/21/5330372/super-bowl-2014-betting-odds-denver-broncos-favored-vs-seattle-seahawks) to Broncos -2.5 by kickoff. [^2]

## In Basketball Too

This also happens in other sports.
I'm thinking in particular of Vegas' love of the Celtics for the past couple years.
Prior to the start of the conference semifinals in the 2022-2023 playoffs, the Celtics [were](https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nba-main/?y=2022-2023&sa=nba&a=finals&o=r) +180 to win the title.
The eventual champion Nuggets were at +700.
The Celtics ended up losing in the conference finals to the Heat: it's difficult to describe how bad they looked in that series.
They needed a game winning put back buzzer beater in game 6 just to force a game 7, which they ended up losing by 20 at home.
Watching the series, it looked like the Celtics were basically just giving the ball to one of their guys and waiting around for him to shoot a 3.
The Nuggets played the Heat in the finals that year and easily beat them in 5 games.
Watching the Nuggets, they just seemed to play as a *team* so much better than Boston: they're a lot less dependent on shooting 3's, there's a lot more movement and cutting, etc.
I don't have any sources for this, but just listening to fans and media, I think this is how most fans feel.

After all this, can you guess what the title odds were going into the next season?
They had basically [identical](https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nba-main/?y=2023-2024&sa=nba&a=finals&o=r) title odds.
The Nuggets were actually slight favorites, at +500, compared to the Celtics at +550.
But the fact that the Celtics were *still* getting basically the same odds as Denver, despite looking so much worse in the playoffs, was surprising.
Also, once the Celtics traded for Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis in the offseason, the odds shifted back in their favor: +400 for them, +550 for the Nuggets.

The Celtics went on to have a [historically](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1c4a82w/the_bostons_celtics_end_the_2324_season_with_the/) great regular season, while the Nuggets had a very good season.
The Celtics are also in the much weaker Eastern Conference, so their path to the Finals is easier.
It is therefore understandable that prior to the start of the 2023-2024 playoffs, the Celtics were +160 favorites, compared to Denver at +300.[^3]
Yet many fans, myself included, still trust Denver a lot more.
For example, around this same time,
I remember listening to Celtics fan Bill Simmons saying he doesn't think they can beat the Nuggets in a 7-game series.
Kevin O'Connor [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/billsimmons/comments/1ccgyzw/kevin_ocopium_the_celtics_would_get_swept_by/) that the Celtics would get *swept* by the Nuggets.

## So, Why?

In summary, Vegas likes Kyle Shanahan's 49ers, the Legion of Boom Seahawks, and the Tatum and Mazulla's Celtics, while
fans and the public like Mahomes' Chiefs, Peyton Manning's Broncos, and Jokic's Nuggets.

This isn't a huge sample size, but I think there is a bit of a pattern here.
The public cares more about star power.
For football--they particularly care about star power at quarterback: Mahomes and Peyton Manning were both considered the best quarterbacks in the world at the time.
Vegas carees more about well-rounded rosters: Purdy and Russell Wilson were both good quarterbacks, but the key was that they were still on their rookie deals, which allowed their teams to stack the rest of their roster. [^4]
In basketball, Jokic is considered the best player in the world, while Tatum is considered good but not close to Jokic.
This seems to have a greater pull amongst the fans, while Vegas cares more about the Celtics' stacked supporting cast: Jrue Holiday is probably their worst starter (and he was the 3rd best player on the championship-winning Bucks in 2021).

In basketball, I also get the sense that fans care more about "vibes" and the "eye test", while I'm guessing that Vegas cares more about stats.
There's something about Denver that you just trust (especially in the clutch); they just look like a well-oiled machine when they play.
And there just seems to be something off vibes-wise with the Celtics; but it seems like Vegas doesn't care about that as much as the Celtics' record-breaking point differential.

## In Other Areas

**In Movies**: I remember really liking the movie *Where the Crawdads Sing*, and the public agrees with me: it has a [96/100](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/where_the_crawdads_sing) audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. But critics hated it, giving the movie a 35/100.
I personally haven't watched as many movies that critics love but audiences hated (there are [some](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_witch_2016)).
But I think there is a pattern here as well: the public likes more melodramatic, faster-paced movies, while critics tend to like slower-paced, "artsy", subtle movies.

[^1] It's true that the odds have shifted since then. I'm guessing that part of that is due to the [uncertainty](https://www.si.com/nfl/john-lynch-says-the-49ers-wont-trade-brandon-aiyuk-or-deebo-samuel#:~:text=The%2049ers%20seriously%20considered%20trading,on%20The%20Pat%20McAfee%20Show.) about Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel. Also, maybe there was some public money coming in on the Chiefs.

[^2] In case you were curious about the result, the Seahawks won in a blowout, 43-8. But that doesn't mean sharp bettors are always right-- a single game is an almost meaninglessly small sample size, in my opinion.

[^3] If the Celtics play the Nuggets in the Finals, I'm very curious what the odds will be. If the Nuggets end up being favored, then perhaps I'm mistaken in how much Vegas actually likes the Celtics, and their good title odds are just a product of how weak the East is.

[^4] To just name a few: 49ers had: McCaffrey, Kittle, Aiyuk, Deebo Samuel, etc. On defense, they had Nick Bosa, Fred Warner, etc. Seahawks had Marshawn Lynch, Percy Harvin, Doug Baldwin, on offense. On defense they had the Legion of Boom: Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas, etc.
