    <h1>Ranking every NBA champion since 2011</h1>
    
    <p class="secondary">29 June, 2024</p>
    
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>The Celtics just won the NBA championship, so I decided to rank every NBA champion since the 2010-2011 season, which is about when I started following the NBA.</p>
<p>The way I ranked the teams was based on who I think is <em>better</em>, not necessarily which team had more impressive accomplishments.
In other words, I asked myself who I would pick to win a 7 game series, not necessarily which team had more impressive stats or a tougher road in the playoffs (although, obviously these things both are factors when thinking about who would win a series).</p>
<p>Also, all the stats are from <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/questions">StatMuse</a>, ESPN, or Wikipedia. Mainly StatMuse though.</p>
<h3 id="tier-1-unfairly-good">Tier 1: Unfairly Good</h3>
<p><strong>1. '16-'17 Warriors</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 67-15, +11.6 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-1 (beat Cavs in 5 in Finals).</p>
<p>'16-'17 Warriors at #1 is pretty easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>73 win team that added Kevin Durant</li>
<li>4th best PPG differential all-time, best since '95-'96 Bulls</li>
<li>Never challenged in the playoffs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. '17-'18 Warriors</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 58-24, +6 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-5 (beat Cavs in 4 in Finals).</p>
<p>Unlike the 2016-2017 Warriors, this team did face adversity in the playoffs: they were down 3-2 to the Rockets in the conference finals before Chris Paul got injured, helping the Warriors win the next two games.</p>
<p>However, there are a couple of reasons I still have this Warriors team so high:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rockets team they beat in 7 was <em>very</em> good: 65-17 with a +8.5 PPG differential in the regular season.
They had prime James Harden, Chris Paul, Eric Gordon, and Clint Capela, and everyone on their roster had a well-defined role and played well together.</li>
<li>The '17-'18 Warriors clearly had a more talented roster compared to any other team on this list, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. I would still pick them to win a series over any of the teams below them on this list.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tier-2-great-even-compared-to-other-nba-champions">Tier 2: Great, even compared to other NBA champions</h3>
<p><strong>3. '13-'14 Spurs</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 62-20, +7.7 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-7 (beat Heat in 5 in Finals).</p>
<p>The Spurs had a great regular season, but their playoff run is why I have them so high.
They weirdly took 7 games to beat the 8-seed Mavs in the first round, before beating the Blazers in 5 in the next round.
They beat the (MVP Season) Kevin Durant and Russel Westbrook Thunder in 6 in the conference finals.</p>
<p>In the NBA Finals, they played the back-to-back reigning champions Heat (who they had lost to in the Finals the previous year): and they didn't just beat the Heat, they won by a then-record for <em>largest PPG differential in NBA finals history</em>.
Imagine if next year, the 49ers go 13-4, get back to the Super Bowl, and beat the Chiefs 52-7: that's basically what the Spurs did in 2014.
Watching them in the Finals against the Heat might have been the best I've ever seen a team play over a 7-game series.</p>
<p><strong>4. '12-'13 Heat</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 66-16, +7.9 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-7 (Beat Spurs in 7 in the Finals)</p>
<p>Probably Lebron's best individual season and team ever.
Lebron was MVP, Finals MVP, and 2nd in DPOY, and the Heat won 66 games including a 27 game win streak (2nd longest win streak all time).
The reason why they're behind the Spurs is that the 2012-2013 Spurs came close (and probably should have) beaten them---this was the series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr6XsZVb-ZE">Ray Allen</a> made a last-second three to save the Heat. And I think the following year's version of the Spurs got better and, as mentioned, easily beat the Heat in the following NBA Finals.</p>
<p><strong>5. '15-'16 Cavs</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 57-25, +6 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-5, (Beat Warriors in 7 in the Finals)</p>
<p>I think the Cavs' slightly underwhelming regular season statistics can be explained by 2 factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lebron was getting older, so I think he was conserving his energy in the regular season so he can play his best in the playoffs.</li>
<li>The East wasn't that strong so they could coast after they were in a comfortable position to secure the 1 seed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Their playoff run is why I ranked them so high: they pretty easily made it to the Finals, before facing the 73-win Warriors in the Finals.
Obviously Draymond Green was suspended for Game 5, and the Warriors may have unwisely expended a lot of energy going for 73 wins, but beating a 73-win team is still very impressive.</p>
<p>Another reason I have them so high is because of how good I think Kyrie Irving is.
He is routinely named by other NBA players as the most <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/mavericks/news/game-winner-luka-doncic-stephen-a-smith-most-skilled-ever-kyrie-irving-special-shot-dallas-mavs-world-react#:~:text=Most%20Skilled%20Ever!-,&#x27;%20Kyrie%20Irving%20&#x27;Special&#x27;%20Shot%3A%20Dallas%20Mavs%20%26%20NBA,win%20over%20the%20Denver%20Nuggets.">skilled</a> player ever, and he was amazing this season--- particularly in the Finals (he outscored Steph Curry 27 ppg vs. 22.6 ppg on similar shooting splits, including the game-winning 3 in Game 7).
Any team with prime Lebron and prime Kyrie ranks high in my opinion, even if their regular season stats aren't quite as impressive.</p>
<p><strong>6. '11-'12 Heat</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 46-20 (on pace for 57-25), +6 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-7, (Beat Thunder in 5 in the Finals)</p>
<p>The '11-'12 Heat were pretty clearly worse than the '12-'13 Heat: their regular season stats (while good) are nowhere near their '12-'13 season.
They also did not have Ray Allen yet.
Furthermore, they were down 3-2 to the 4-seed Celtics (who Ray Allen played for at the time), before Lebron played arguably the greatest game of his career in Game 6, helping the Heat to force a game 7 that they would eventually win.
In fact, they were actually <em>underdogs</em> against the Thunder in the Finals that year.</p>
<p>I still rank this Heat team highly for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They still had prime Lebron and prime Dwyane Wade. Like the '17-'18 Warriors and '15-'16 Cavs, I tend to give teams with talented rosters the benefit of the doubt.</li>
<li>Another reason this Heat team was underdogs vs. the Thunder in the 2012 Finals is because of how good the Thunder were. They had Kevin Durant, Russell, Westbrook, James Harden, Serge Ibaka, etc. (3 future MVPs on the same roster).
And they had just won 4 straight vs. the Spurs in the conference finals after going down 0-2.
To beat the Thunder in 5 games is very impressive.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tier-3-really-good-even-compared-to-other-nba-champions">Tier 3: Really good, even compared to other NBA champions</h3>
<p><strong>7. '23-'24 Celtics</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 64-18, +11.3 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-3, (Beat Mavs in 5 in the Finals)</p>
<p>Statistically, the Celtics are probably better than any team on this list apart from the '16-'17 Warriors.
They had the 5th best point differential in NBA history and were never even pushed to a game 6 in the playoffs.</p>
<p>It may be unfair to the Celtics, but the reason I don't have them ahead of the Tier 2 teams is because I don't think they had as difficult competition as any of those teams.
The '12 and '13 Heat and the '14 Spurs had each other to compete with (along with the Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook Thunder teams) and the '16 Cavs had to compete with the 73-win Warriors.</p>
<p>I don't think the Celtics had to compete with anyone as good as the teams I just mentioned: they had an incredibly easy path to the Finals (faced zero 50 win teams, and literally every team they played in the East had their best player injured), before facing a healthy 50-win Mavs team in the finals.
The Mavs are good, but I don't think they're on the level of the teams I mentioned previously.
Maybe if the Mavs end up winning multiple championships, then I'll view this Celtics team differently.
But for now, I honestly wouldn't feel confident picking the '23-'24 Celtics in a 7 game series against the '11-'12 Heat.</p>
<p><strong>8. '22-'23 Nuggets</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 53-29, +3.3 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-4, (Beat Heat in 5 in the Finals)</p>
<p>Out of all the teams on this list, this may have been my favorite team to watch, so I'm probably a bit biased towards them, and perhaps have ranked them too highly (the stats would certainly indicate that I have).
Like the '15-'16 Cavs, I'm not bothered too much by their somewhat underwhelming regular season because I think they comfortably had the 1 seed and were coasting until the playoffs.</p>
<p>However, this team--- as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHpRYupC4ws">Jamal Murray</a> routinely does--- significantly raised their level in the playoffs.
Arguably their biggest weakness was defense: they finished the regular season with a mediocre 112.8 defensive rating (15th out of 30 NBA teams).
However, they had a 110.8 playoff defensive rating (3rd out of 16 postseason teams, and would have been 2nd in the regular season that year).
Their 117.6 regular season offensive rating was 5th in the league, while their 119.5 playoff offensive rating was 1st out of 16 postseason teams, and would have been 1st in the regular season that year.</p>
<p>The Nuggets faced some very good (although not great) teams in the playoffs: the Suns w/ CP3, Booker, and KD, the Lebron &amp; AD Lakers, and the Jimmy Butler Heat team that had beaten the Bucks and Celtics on the road to the finals.
Impressively, they were never really challenged by any of these teams: their closest series was vs. the Suns in 6 games; while the Suns did win 2 straight against them to tie the series at 2-2, KD and Booker had to combine for 79 ppg over those two games.
The Nuggets then won games 5 and 6 by 16 and 25 points respectively.</p>
<p>Another important reason I have them so high is because of how impressive they were when I watched them play.
Their offense was like a well-oiled machine: Jokic constantly makes good decisions that lead to open shots (for him or his teammates), Murray shot very well in the 2023 playoffs (much better than 2024), they aren't reliant on making their 3-pointers (they were 15th out of the 16 playoff teams that year in 3-point attempts/game: probably part of the reason their PPG differential wasn't as high), and they had a go-to play when they needed to score (Murray-Jokic pick and roll).
All of this made the Nuggets a very steady, reliable team that again, was never really challenged in the playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>9. '14-'15 Warriors</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 67-15, +10.1 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-5, (Beat Cavs in 6 in the Finals)</p>
<p>67-15 is tied for the best record on this list, and +10.1 ppg differential is 3rd best.
Based on the stats, they should probably be higher.</p>
<p>The reason I don't rate this team as highly as others probably do is that I don't think their playoff run was quite as impressive.
The Warriors were challenged in two of their playoff series: they were down 2-1 to the Grizzlies in the conference semifinals and 2-1 to the Cavs in the Finals (they ended up winning both series in 6 games).
The Cavs series is particularly relevant, since both Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love were injured (the Cavs were reduced to starting Timofey Mozgov, Thristian Thompson, Iman Shumpert and Matthew Dellavedova alongside Lebron in that series).</p>
<p>Another reason I don't have them as high is because, even though this was one of Steph's two MVP seasons, I'm not even sure this was one of the five best seasons of his career.
For one point of reference: it was his 10th highest season in his career in terms of PPG (obviously the increase in scoring overall in the NBA over the past 10 years has something to do with this stat).
In other words, I don't look at the Steph Curry and the Warriors' future success as evidence of how great their 2014-2015 team was.
I think the Warriors, and Steph in particular, got a lot better in the few years after their '14-'15 season.</p>
<p>That said, they still had historically great regular season stats and never faced a game 7 in the playoffs.</p>
<h3 id="tier-4-good-even-compared-to-other-nba-champions">Tier 4: Good, even compared to other NBA champions</h3>
<p><strong>(Tied) 10.'19-'20 Lakers</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 52-19 (on pace for 60-22), +5.8 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-5, (Beat Heat in 6 in the Finals)</p>
<p>This is a very difficult team to rank.
The Lakers were having a very good regular season before it got interrupted by COVID.
They went on to win the championship when the season resumed in the bubble.</p>
<p>Some obvious reasons to rank the Lakers high: (1) On pace for a 60-win season (2) Two top 75 all-time players at or near their prime: AD was in his prime, and Lebron was just leaving his.</p>
<p>Some reasons to rank them lower: (1) I don't think Lebron was quite what he was in Miami/Cleveland (2) Lebron and AD's supporting cast wan't quite as strong (their third best player was probably Kyle Kuzma) and (3) I think the Lakers had a relatively easy path to the championship.
The Clippers were supposed to be their main competition, but blew a 3-1 lead to the Nuggets, and this Nuggets team had not reached its peak yet (to give one point of reference: the Lakers played the Nuggets 3 years later in the playoffs and the Nuggets swept them).
In the Finals, the Lakers beat the Heat in 6--- but the Heat's 2nd and 3rd leading scorers (Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic) were both injured.</p>
<p><strong>(Tied) 10.'18-'19 Raptors</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 58-24, +6 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-8, (Beat Warriors in 6 in the Finals)</p>
<p>This is another good-not-great regular season.
But when Kawhi Leonard is your best player, regular season stats aren't that important--- it's the playoffs that count.</p>
<p>The Raptors had an <em>extremely</em> impressive playoff run.
In the conference semifinals, they beat a Sixers team that had Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons (when he was still good), and Jimmy Butler.
I think people underrate how good the Sixers were that year: that's an incredibly strong top 3 players and probably the best team Joel Embiid has been on.
They then won 4 straight against the 60-win, MVP Gianns-led Bucks after losing the first 2 games.</p>
<p>They then beat the Warriors in 6 in the Finals: most people point to the fact that KD was injured for basically the entire series, and Klay Thompson got injured in Game 6.
But the Raptors still went up 3-1 against the Warriors with a healthy Steph, Klay, and Draymond.
That's pretty impressive. In my opinion, they're clearly better any of the teams below them.</p>
<p>The reason I don't have them ahead of the Lakers is because I don't think the Raptors' 2nd best player (Pascal Siakam) was nearly as good as the Lakers' (Anthony Davis).
So despite the fact that they probably accomplished more than the 2020 Lakers, the Lakers' roster (in particular their two stars) made it difficult me to put them over the Lakers.</p>
<p><strong>(Tied) 10.'10-'11 Mavs</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 57-25, +4.2 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-5, (Beat Heat in 6 in the Finals)</p>
<p>This is probably the most difficult team to rank: I simultaneously feel that I both have them ranked too high and too low.
They had a good (but not great) regular season, but the key is their playoff run.</p>
<p>On the surface, they had an unbelievably great playoffs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swept the 2-time defending champion Lakers in the 2nd round</li>
<li>Beat the KD/Westbrook/Harden Thunder in 5 the conference finals</li>
<li>Beat Lebron's Heat Superteam in 6 in the NBA Finals</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason I don't think people (perhaps myself included) give this Mavs team as much credit as they should is that people focused more on why their opponents lost than why the Mavs won.
For example, people point to Kobe and Pau being too old, KD and Westbrook being too young, and Lebron just choking.
(There is some validity to this last point: Lebron was outscored by Jason Terry this series, and went 4 straight 4th quarters with 2 points or fewer).
While I suppose it's justified to focus more on Lebron choking in the Finals, I still think their run to get to the Finals was <em>really</em> impressive.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know where to rank them, so I have just stuck them along with the two other teams that I think were very good.</p>
<h3 id="tier-6-honestly-not-that-good-compared-to-other-nba-champions">Tier 6: Honestly not that good compared to other NBA champions</h3>
<p><strong>13.'21-'22 Warriors</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 53-29, +5.5 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-6, (Beat Celtics in 6 in the Finals)</p>
<p>This Warriors team started the regular season 18-2 before cooling off in the second half of the season.</p>
<p>In the playoffs, they played a lot of good-but-not-great teams.
They beat the Nuggets in 5 (but Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. were injured).
Then they beat the Ja Morant-led Grizzlies in 6, they beat the Luka Doncic-led (but without Kyrie Irving) Mavs in 5 games, before beating the Celtics in 6 in the Finals in Ime Udoka's first and only season as coach.
While these teams are probably more difficult than, for example, the Lakers' run to a championship, I don't think it's a particularly difficult road.</p>
<p>I also just don't think their roster was as good as it was in previous years.
Steph was of course great (IMO better than in '14-'15), but Draymond Green averaged a triple-single that year, and Klay Thompson was still recovering from his injuries and nowhere near his pre-injury level.
Their second best player was <em>probably</em> Andrew Wiggins, who played great in the playoffs but isn't someone you normally think of as being the level of the second best player on a championship team.</p>
<p>Even though they beat the Celtics in 6, the series was very close: they entered Game 4 down 2-1, and they were down, on the road, at halftime of Game 4.
Steph ended up scoring 43 in that game and they ended up winning that game (and the next 2).
But I think this series (and the entire season) was more about Steph Curry being great individually than the Warriors as a team being great.</p>
<p><strong>14.'20-'21 Bucks</strong></p>
<p>Regular season record: 46-26 (on pace for 52-30), +5.9 PPG differential</p>
<p>Playoff record: 16-7, (Beat Suns in 6 in the Finals)</p>
<p>While this team was obviously great, I don't think they were as good compared to the other teams on this list.</p>
<p>Their regular season was good-not-great--- but to be fair, lots of teams had only decent regular seasons but still ranked high on this list.
The reason why I have the Bucks low is because of their <em>postseason</em> performance.</p>
<p>The Bucks were somewhat lucky to beat the Nets in round 2.
James Harden got injured very early on in this series and Kyrie got injured in game 4, meaning that 2 of the Nets' &quot;Big 3&quot; were injured.
Even though Harden returned later on in the series, he was clearly still injured and not very effective.
Despite all of this, the Bucks barely won a game 7--- and probably would have lost if Kevin Durant had just worn a slightly smaller <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxa-wDP6n0">shoe</a> size.
(In fact, some of the Bucks' own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/w04OhOEYWFw">players</a> didn't think they were going to beat the Nets.)</p>
<p>In the conference finals, the Bucks were then down 2-1 to the 41-31, Trae Young-led Hawks before winning 3 straight.
I don't think any of the other teams on this list would be tested this much by the Hawks.</p>
<p>And to their credit, they did beat the Suns in 4 straight games after going down 2-0, mainly due to Giannis Antetokounmpo's play.</p>
<p>Honestly, when I watched them in the playoffs, it felt like their offense was never quite clicking.
One point of reference to support this: out of the final 8 teams in the playoffs that year, they had the 7th best in playoff offensive rating.
Like the '21-'22 Warriors, I think this championship was more about Giannis being great individually than the Bucks as a team being great.</p>
