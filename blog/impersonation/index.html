    <p>I consider myself decent at accents and impersonations.
I would like to think I'm better than the median person on the street, but I'm not close to the best professionals on TV.
I used to love watching impersonators, both for entertainment and sometimes to improve my own impersonations.
I specifically remember watching a surprising number of good Obama impersonators (e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc8rUXlTvXo">Jay Pharoah</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu2U-zOyWkA">Jordan Peele</a>).</p>
<p>So, back to the title of the blog post: what makes a good impersonator?
The question I'm particularly interested in is how we, as humans, judge the accuracy of an impersonation.
On the surface the answer might seem obvious: we judge impersonators based on how similar they sound to their subject.
If you imagine the subject's actual voice as the bullseye of a target, we judge impersonations by how close they are to hitting that bullseye.
The closer to the bullseye, the better the impersonation.</p>
<p>The &quot;thesis&quot; of this blog post is that this is a fundamentally incorrect way of viewing things.
This stems from my own experiences trying to do impersonations: I have found that trying to learn an impersonation by mimicking exactly how the subject sounds is usually a recipe for failure.
In fact, I am going to (unscientifically) speculate that this false premise is the reason why the median person is so bad at impersonations: they are trying to sound exactly like their subject. This makes the task exponentially more difficult than it needs to be.</p>
<p>Here's my take.
When a person speaks, many aspects of their voice sound pretty similar to one another (we're all humans, after all: you would never mistake a human voice for a monkey's or a whale's).
But each person also has a few distinctive features when they talk that are unique to them. For example, here are Obama's:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes he kind of starts sentences slowly and with a low voice, and then kind of speeds up and raises his pitch towards the end of the sentence or phrase.</li>
<li>Sometimes he has this low, scratchy &quot;ehhhhh&quot; when he's searching for what word to use next.</li>
<li>And his most distinctive but hardest to describe characteristic: his actual voice. It's almost like he has a big round bubble in his mouth that he's trying to throw up (kind of like how people sound when underwater and there's only bubbles coming out of their mouth, but much milder). I have no idea if this description makes any sense, but it's the best way I can describe his voice.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would argue that the &quot;good&quot; Obama impersonators do not necessarily <em>mimic</em> these characteristics exactly as Obama does them: rather, they <em>exaggerate</em> these characteristics.
Not only do they exaggerate their severity (e.g., how much Obama speeds up at the end of his sentences), but they also exaggerate how often he does these things (e.g., how much Obama uses the low scratchy &quot;ehhhh&quot;).
So a good impersonator doesn't necessarily mimic/sound similar to their subject: rather, they (sometimes comically) <em>exaggerate the distinctive characteristics of their subject</em>.
This is definitely the case for me when I do an impersonation: I'm much more successful when I try to exaggerate the distinctive characteristics of the subject rather than try to mimic all their different characteristics.</p>
<p>Pursuing this strategy for impersonations makes things a lot easier.
First, it is much easier to exaggerate a characteristic than to precisely mimic one.
Secondly, since you exaggerate how often you employ a given characteristic (e.g., you can use Obama's low scratchy &quot;ehhh&quot; every sentence) you don't need to prepare that many characteristics: you only need a few, and you can keep going &quot;back to the well&quot;.
If you notice most impersonators, the flow/tone of their sentences is very similar for each sentence (e.g., most Obama impersonators do the exaggerated slow-down-then-speed-up for nearly every sentence), despite the fact that most humans rarely ever actually talk like that.
But it's just easier to get good at one sentence &quot;structure&quot; and then repeatedly do it, rather than trying to learn how Obama speaks for every possible sentence &quot;structure&quot;.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the most difficult part of doing this is (1) identifying the subject's distinguishing characteristics and (2) learning how to exaggerate those characteristics.
This is why I've actually found it much more helpful to watch impersonators compared to the subjects themselves.
The impersonators have (perhaps subconsciously) already identified the distinguishing characteristics of their subject and <em>really</em> exaggerate them, making it much easier for me to identify and replicate.
So ironically, my advice for trying to do an Obama impersonation would be the following: instead of trying to impersonate Obama, instead <em>try to impersonate a good Obama impersonator</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>I recently read <em>The Undoing Project</em> by Michael Lewis, which summarizes the life and research of two Israeli psychologists, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman.
The best and most succinct way I can describe their work is identifying and understanding optical illusions, but for the brain (Lewis uses this analogy several times throughout the book).
For example, they would ask college students the following question (p. 189):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The frequency of letters in the English language was studied. A typical text was selected, and the relative frequency with which various letters of the alphabet appeared in the first and third positions of the words was recorded. Words of less than three letters were excluded from the count.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the letter K. Is K more likely to appear in (a) the first position or (b) the third position?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Predictably, most people believed that K was more likely to appear in the first position.
They replicated this experiment for R, L, N, and V.
As it happens, &quot;those letters all appeared more frequently as the third letter in an English word than as the first letter&quot; (p. 189-190).
There is a fairly intuitive explanation for this: &quot;it was simply easier to recall words that start with K than to recall words with K as their third letter&quot; (p. 190).
The book is littered with interesting anecdotes like these.</p>
<p>One of the most enjoyable aspects of the book is that it generalized observations I had already made in my own life. Here's an excerpt from the book, describing how people viewed similarity (p. 111):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[At the time], The reigning theories in psychology of how people made judgements about similarity all had one thing in common: They were based on physical distance. When you compare two things, you are asking how <em>closely</em> they resemble each other. Two objects, two people, two ideas, two emotions: In psychological theory, they existed in the mind as they would on a map, or on a grid, or in some other physical space, as points with some fixed relationship to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One consequence of this theory is that similarity is a symmetrical relationship.
If similarity is basically measuring distance on a grid, then A being similar to B implies that B is similar to A.
But Amos Tversky noticed that this theory of similarity broke down in practice (p. 112):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People thought Tel Aviv was like New York but that New York was not like Tel Aviv. People thought that the number 103 was sort of like the number 100, but that 100 wasn't like 103. People thought a toy train was a lot like a real train but that a real train was not like a toy train.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lewis then explains Tversky's own theory (p.113):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amos had his own theory, which he called &quot;features of similarity&quot;. He argued that when people compared two things, and judged their similarity, they were essentially making a list of features. These features are simply <em>what they notice</em> about the objects. They count up the noticeable features shared by the two objects: The more they share, the more similar they are; the more they don't share, the more dissimilar they are. Not all objects have the same number of noticeable features: New York City had more of them than Tel Aviv, for instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tversky's theory about similarity is essentially a generalization of the point I made about impersonations.
It's not necessarily about sounding similar to the subject, like two points being close to each other on a grid; rather, the key is to have an impersonation that shares a high number of notable features with the subject.
The only thing I would add to it is that these features are not all weighted equally.
Just as not all letters in a word are equally noticed by people, not all features of an object are equally noticeable.
Therefore, when doing an impression, it is most important to get the most noticeable features down first, before the others.</p>
