    <h1>More on ranking every NBA champion since 2011</h1>
    
    <p class="secondary">21 August, 2024</p>
    
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>I recently wrote a <a href="../historical-nba/">blog post</a> ranking every NBA champion since 2011.
Since then, I've thought about it some more; I've also read other <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nba/ranking-every-nba-champion-since-2000/ss-BB1m6NWa">blog posts</a> and listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfmWUwry-HI">podcasts</a> on this exact topic.
I'll recap where I've changed my mind (and where I haven't) since my initial blog post.</p>
<h1 id="top-5-still-the-same">Top 5: Still the Same</h1>
<p>My top 5 teams were:</p>
<ol>
<li>'16-'17 Warriors</li>
<li>'17-'18 Warriors</li>
<li>'13-'14 Spurs</li>
<li>'12-'13 Heat</li>
<li>'15-'16 Cavs</li>
</ol>
<p>I still feel pretty good about these teams as the top 5 (and in that exact order).</p>
<h1 id="rearrange-6-9">Rearrange 6-9</h1>
<p>My 6-9 teams were:</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>'11-'12 Heat</li>
<li>'23-'24 Celtics</li>
<li>'22-'23 Nuggets</li>
<li>'14-'15 Warriors</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably the &quot;hottest take&quot; of my original list was having the '22-'23 Nuggets ahead of the '14-'15 Warriors.
After thinking about it, the Nuggets just don't have the stats of an elite team.
I still think the Nuggets were really impressive using my &quot;eye test&quot;â€“ but my &quot;eye test&quot; also thought that the Mavs were more impressive than the Celtics leading up to last year's Finals, and the Celtics easily won the series in 5 games.
So I would re-rank the Nuggets as a pretty clear 9th.</p>
<p>I would still rank the '23-'24 Celtics ahead of the 14-'15 Warriors, who I think are slightly overrated for reasons that I already discussed in the previous blog post.</p>
<p>While the '11-'12 Heat did have Lebron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, in addition to beating a great Thunder team in the Finals that year, their overall stats just weren't that good.
One common theme I'm realizing is that I don't think I put enough emphasis on stats, and I put too much emphasis on eye test (in the case of the Nuggets) and big names (in the case of the Heat).
I would drop them below both the Celtics and the Warriors.</p>
<p>So my updated rankings are:</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>'23-'24 Celtics</li>
<li>'14-'15 Warriors</li>
<li>'11-'12 Heat</li>
<li>'22-'23 Nuggets</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="actually-ranking-teams-10-12-instead-of-picking-a-tie">Actually Ranking Teams 10-12 Instead of Picking a Tie</h1>
<p>Originally I had the following teams tied for 10th: the '19-'20 Lakers, '18-'19 Raptors, and '10-'11 Mavs.
I still think it's very close between these three teams, but I feel like I kind of took the easy way out by selecting a tie, and I don't want to do that anymore.</p>
<p>Even though the Mavs had an all-time great playoff run, I think I would place them last among these three teams: they didn't have great regular season stats, nor did they have a great roster.
Between the '19-'20 Lakers and the '18-'19 Raptors, I guess I would pick the '19-'20 Lakers: when in doubt, I am going to lean towards the team with the better top-end stars, and the Lakers had Lebron and AD.</p>
<p>So the updated rankings are:</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>'19-'20 Lakers</li>
<li>'18-'19 Raptors</li>
<li>'10-'11 Mavs</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="ranking-the-last-2-teams">Ranking the last 2 teams</h1>
<p>The final two teams were:</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>'21-'22 Warriors</li>
<li>'20-'21 Bucks</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel pretty good about these rankings.
I think I'm lower on the '20-'21 Bucks than most.
In fact, if I were to change anything, I might have the '21-'22 Warriors ahead of the '10-'11 Mavs.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-my-updated-rankings">Conclusion: My Updated Rankings</h1>

<li>'23-'24 Celtics</li>
