    <h1>NFL Season Preview &amp; Predictions</h1>
    
    <p class="secondary">3 September, 2024</p>
    
    <div class="space"></div>
    <p>My favorite sports TV show is <em>First Things First</em>.
Last week, each analyst on the show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJp3SHmVlGE">predicted</a> the standings for each division, as well as their AFC, NFC and Super Bowls champions.
I'm going to do something similar in this blog post.
I'm also going to do predictions as if I'm on the actual TV show, meaning that I will be a bit bolder (so the predictions are more entertaining), rather than solely picking who I think has the highest probability of wining the division/conference.</p>
<p>I think this exercise can also make the NFL season more entertaining as a viewer, since I'll sort of be rooting for the teams that I picked to do well.</p>
<h1 id="afc">AFC</h1>
<h2 id="afc-east">AFC East</h2>
<ol>
<li>Jets (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Bills (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Dolphins</li>
<li>Patriots</li>
</ol>
<p>The Jets won 7 games last year with possibly the worst starting quarterback in the NFL, so I have them first.
While the Bills lost a <em>ton</em> of players on both offense and defense, they still at least have Josh Allen.
For the past two seasons, the Dolphins seem to both (a) get worse as the season goes on and (b) have difficulty beating good teams.
Patriots are a clear 4th in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="afc-west">AFC West</h2>
<ol>
<li>Chiefs (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Chargers (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Raiders</li>
<li>Broncos</li>
</ol>
<p>Chiefs are clear number 1.
I think the Chargers will be good, since Jim Harbaugh has done well every time he's gone to a new team (e.g., Stanford, 49ers, Michigan).
I don't think the Broncos or Raiders will be that good, but I guess I'll put the Raiders above the Broncos.</p>
<h2 id="afc-north">AFC North</h2>
<ol>
<li>Bengals (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Ravens (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Browns</li>
<li>Steelers</li>
</ol>
<p>I think Joe Burrow is the 2nd best quarterback in the NFL, and I think the Bengals will be motivated after a down year.
I'm not as worried about Ja'Marr Chase's holdout since the Bengals have started slow each of the past few seasons before picking it up after a month or so.
Also, on the TV show you are encouraged to pick a &quot;worst-to-first&quot; (team that goes from worst in division to first), and I think the Bengals are a good candidate for that.
For some reason I just don't believe in the Ravens: it seems like last year was &quot;the&quot; year that they should have won the Super Bowl: everything was setting up perfectly (Chiefs in a down year, AFC championship game at home, Lamar MVP, top ranked defense in NFL), and they let it slip away.
I think the Browns will have bad quarterbacking and great defense, meaning they'll be decent.
And I think this is the year that Mike Tomlin finally has a losing record: he has somehow managed to have a winning record with pretty bad teams over the past few years; I think this is the year it ends.</p>
<h2 id="afc-south">AFC South</h2>
<ol>
<li>Colts (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Texans</li>
<li>Jaguars</li>
<li>Titans</li>
</ol>
<p>If I were on TV I would need to make a bold prediction, so this one is mine: Colts win the division while the Texans and Jags miss the playoffs.
The Colts and Texans were both 9-7 last year, before the Texans beat the Colts 23-19 in the last game of the season to win the division: so the Colts were a game away from winning the division with Gardner Minshew as their quarterback.
They now have Anthony Richardson, who looked pretty good during the short time he played last year.
Also, I feel like the Texans may have a bit <em>too</em> much hype this year (maybe it's just an anti-CJ Stroud bias as a Michigan fan): so because everyone is predicting them to do well, I guess I'll be a contrarian.
The Jaguars haven't won double-digit games with Trevor Lawrence yet, and I'm not sure if they'll ever be a great team.
And the Titans are a clear 4th in my opinion.</p>
<h2 id="afc-playoff-seeding">AFC Playoff Seeding</h2>
<ol>
<li>Chiefs</li>
<li>Bengals</li>
<li>Jets</li>
<li>Colts</li>
<li>Chargers</li>
<li>Ravens</li>
<li>Bills</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="nfc">NFC</h1>
<h2 id="nfc-east">NFC East</h2>
<ol>
<li>Eagles (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Cowboys</li>
<li>Commanders</li>
<li>Giants</li>
</ol>
<p>I had a tough time picking between the Eagles and Cowboys, since I don't think either will be amazing this year.
I picked the Eagles because they still have a super talented roster.
Even though were <em>so</em> bad at the end of last year, I ironically have a bit more confidence in them since the end of last year seems like <em>such</em> a bizarre anomaly (or as Chris Broussard called it, a &quot;supernatural funk&quot;) that you can sort of just discount it.
I don't like the trajectory of the Cowboys: they have had 3 straight seasons in which they have won 12 games and then disappointed in the playoffs.
I think eventually they'll have a down regular season.
It reminds me a bit of Jim Harbaugh with the 49ers--- three great years to start followed by a mediocre 8-8 season.
And since I'm from the DC area, I went with the local team (Commanders) ahead of the Giants.</p>
<h2 id="nfc-west">NFC West</h2>
<ol>
<li>Rams (Playoffs)</li>
<li>49ers (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Cardinals</li>
<li>Seahawks</li>
</ol>
<p>I really like the Rams this year. I think their offense will be great: Matt Stafford is probably a top 5 QB, Sean McVay is possibly the best offensive coach in the NFL, and they'll have two really good wide receivers. Even though Aaron Donald retired, I still think the defense will be good enough.
49ers have had a somewhat turbulent off-season: Brandon Aiyuk and Trent Williams held out most of training camp, so they may be a bit rusty.
In particular, I'm a bit worried that they will have a slow start (people in the media like to call this a &quot;Superbowl Hangover&quot;).
They still have an incredibly talented roster, but part of me feels that (like the Ravens) last year was &quot;the&quot; year for them.
Finally, I don't know who will be better between the Cardinals and Seahawks, so I somewhat arbitrarily chose the Cardinals.</p>
<h2 id="nfc-north">NFC North</h2>
<ol>
<li>Lions (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Packers (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Bears (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Vikings</li>
</ol>
<p>I like the Lions a lot this year. I really like the fact that all the players seem to like Dan Campbell, and I think they'll be motivated after blowing a big lead in last year's NFC Championship.
The Packers were very hot to close the year, and played amazing against the Cowboys in the playoffs, and then almost beat the 49ers.
I think they'll be really good.
Caleb Williams is getting a lot of hype, and I do think the Bears will be better than the Vikings.
Since I don't believe in the Cowboys, I decided to put the Bears in the playoffs.</p>
<h2 id="nfc-south">NFC South</h2>
<ol>
<li>Falcons (Playoffs)</li>
<li>Buccaneers</li>
<li>Panthers</li>
<li>Saints</li>
</ol>
<p>I went pretty standard with this division: I don't think any of the teams will be that good.
I feel bad for Bryce Young though, so I didn't want him to finish last again.</p>
<h2 id="nfc-playoff-seeding">NFC Playoff Seeding</h2>
<ol>
<li>Lions</li>
<li>Rams</li>
<li>Eagles</li>
<li>Falcons</li>
<li>49ers</li>
<li>Packers</li>
<li>Bears</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="playoffs">Playoffs</h1>
<h2 id="afc-playoffs">AFC Playoffs</h2>
<h3 id="afc-wildcard">AFC Wildcard</h3>
<p>(2) Bengals defeat (7) Bills.</p>
<p>(3) Jets defeat (6) Ravens.</p>
<p>(5) Chargers defeat (4) Colts. (I really like the Chargers, since I think their coach-quarterback combination is really good).</p>
<h3 id="afc-divisional">AFC Divisional</h3>
<p>(5) Chargers defeat (1) Chiefs (This is basically just wishful thinking, although to be fair nobody expected the 49ers to make the NFC championship in Harbaugh's first year. I'm also thinking this could be the scenario where the Chiefs win both regular season matchups against the Chargers and then the Chargers beat them in the playoffs).</p>
<p>(3) Jets defeat (2) Bengals. For some reason I like the Jets a lot this year. Maybe it's the fact that the Jets with Rodgers remind me a bit of the Bucs with Brady in his first year. I also think it would be a cool story if Rodgers was able to get to the AFC Championship Game a year after getting injured on literally the first drive of last season.</p>
<h3 id="afc-championship">AFC Championship</h3>
<p>(3) Jets defeat (5) Chargers. Interestingly, I'm predicting 2 teams in the AFC championship that many people don't even think will make the playoffs.</p>
<h2 id="nfc-playoffs">NFC Playoffs</h2>
<h3 id="nfc-wildcard">NFC Wildcard</h3>
<p>(2) Rams defeat (7) Bears.</p>
<p>(6) Packers defeat (3) Eagles. (As I said above, I don't believe in the Eagles very much this year.)</p>
<p>(5) 49ers defeat (4) Falcons.</p>
<h3 id="nfc-divisional">NFC Divisional</h3>
<p>(1) Lions defeat (6) Packers. This would be an interesting playoff matchup, especially since I think both teams will be really good. I'll go with Detriot since I'm a (somewhat bandwagon) Lions fan.</p>
<p>(2) Rams defeat (5) 49ers. This is a tough game to pick for me, but I think it'll be more bold to have the Rams in the NFC championship compared to the 49ers, so I'll go with the Rams.</p>
<h3 id="nfc-championship">NFC Championship</h3>
<p>(1) Lions defeat (2) Rams.</p>
<h3 id="super-bowl">Super Bowl</h3>
<p>Lions defeat Jets. Since I already picked the Lions to make the Super Bowl, I might was well pick them to win it.</p>
